Test Plots
==========
Each python file in this directory should have a function main() which creates
a matplotlib figure and returns the figure instance.  Running the script
``process_testplots.py`` in the root directory will run all scripts, save the
results as png (via matplotlib), save the results as html (via mpld3), and
create an html file which displays them side-by-side.
